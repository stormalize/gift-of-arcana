# Gift of Arcana

Reffect pack for Guild Wars 2. Requires https://github.com/Zerthox/gw2-reffect.

The original target screen size is `2560 x 1440` with normal UI scaling. There are two provided sizes, both of which may work on smaller or larger screens depending on preference.

- **Major** - original full size that the graphics were drawn at, might be a bit too crowded on `1920 x 1080`
- **Minor** - half size of the original graphics, should fit better on 1080p to 1440p screens and still render pretty well.

Zip archives for both sizes are available under Releases.

## Design Notes

Loosely inspired by the native GW2 UI style. Boons are laid out in a slightly asymmetric layout so that active boons can be identified easier at a glance by reinforcing with unique positions in addition to icons. Boons are split up similar to the Training Golem:

- **Offensive: Sword** - Damage ramping up in the heat of combat. Fury in the pommel, Might in the blade
- **Utility: Book** - Spellbook, or maybe tactician's battle handbook. Quickness, Alacrity, Swiftness, Regeneration, Vigor
- **Defensive: Shield** - Aegis, Protection, Resolution, Resistance, Stability

Key boons are given a bit more prominence for crucial moments during encounters.
